Step-by-step how to research
# How to research? 
## 1. Survey: 
	- Why 
		+ You're not the first one to have that idea 
		+ DON'T RE-INVENTED THE WHEEL
		+ Stay on the GIANT shoulder 	 
	- How 
		+ Searching for 30 related research paper: 
			-> Time: <= 5 years
			-> Reputation: organization, number of citation (depend on the field), references  
		+ Skimming (quick reading): choose 10 papers of your interested (READ EXPERIMENT RESULT)  
		+ After that, read 3-4 papers from the 10 above that has SOTA (state-of-the-art)/fit with your interested 
			-> What is their approach? (In introduction/abstract) 
			-> Difference from previous approach (In introduction/abstract) 
			-> What are they trying to solve? 
			-> What is this paper contribution?  

## 2. Summarize approach:  
	- Use mind map (structural/organize/top-down approach, thinking)      
	- Categorize approach  
	- Pros/cons of each approach. 
		Ex: Object detection: 
			-> Two stage deep feature: RCNN, target RCNN -> pros/cos 
			-> One stage deep feature: YoloV3, EfficientNet,    
			-> Low level feature: SIFT + RANSAC      

## 3. Propose approach: 


## 4. Experiment: 


## 5. Writing paper: 
	- Paper 
	- Thesis 
	- Progress report 

## 6. Publish paper: 
	-> App or conference paper
